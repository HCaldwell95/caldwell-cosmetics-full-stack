<h2>What to Expect</h2>
<br>

<h3>Consultation:</h3>

<p>
    Before your illumiFacial® treatment, you will have a thorough consultation with one of our experienced professionals. This allows us to assess your skin type, 
    discuss your skincare goals, and determine the best approach for your individual needs.
</p>
<br>

<h3>Treatment Steps:</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Cleansing:</strong> Your treatment begins with a deep cleansing of the skin to remove impurities and prepare the skin for enhanced absorption of active ingredients.</li>
    <li><strong>Exfoliation:</strong> A gentle yet effective exfoliation removes dead skin cells, revealing a fresher and smoother complexion.
    <li><strong>Mask Application:</strong> A customized mask is applied to address specific skin concerns such as hydration, brightening, or anti-aging. This step helps to further 
        enhance the effectiveness of the treatment.
    <li><strong>Infusion:</strong> Advanced serums and nutrients are infused into the skin using a specialized device. This step delivers active ingredients deeply into the skin, 
        promoting collagen production and improving overall skin texture.
    <li><strong>Finishing Touches:</strong> The treatment concludes with a soothing moisturizer and SPF application to protect your newly refreshed skin.
</ul>
<br>

<h3>Benefits:</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Brightening:</strong> The illumiFacial® treatment helps to even out skin tone and reduce pigmentation, giving your skin a brighter and more luminous appearance.</li>
    <li><strong>Hydration:</strong> The infusion of hydrating ingredients ensures that your skin remains well-moisturized, helping to combat dryness and dullness.</li>
    <li><strong>Anti-Aging:</strong> The treatment stimulates collagen production, reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, and improving skin elasticity.</li>
    <li><strong>Smooth Texture:</strong> The exfoliation and infusion steps work together to refine skin texture, leaving your skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>

<h3>Aftercare:</h3>

Post-treatment, you may experience some redness or sensitivity, which typically subsides within a few hours. To maintain the results, we recommend following a gentle skincare routine 
and protecting your skin from sun exposure. Our team will provide personalized aftercare instructions to ensure optimal results.
