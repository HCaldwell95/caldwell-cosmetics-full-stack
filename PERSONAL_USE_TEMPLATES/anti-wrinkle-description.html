    <h2>What to Expect</h2>
    <br>

    <h3>Consultation:</h3>

    <p>
        Prior to your Anti-Wrinkle Treatment, you will have a thorough consultation with one of our skilled professionals. This will involve assessing your skin, discussing your aesthetic 
        goals, and customising a treatment plan to achieve the best results for your individual needs.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h3>Treatment Steps:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> The treatment area will be cleansed, and a topical numbing cream may be applied to ensure your comfort during the procedure.</li>
        <li><strong>Injection:</strong> We use advanced techniques to administer our anti-wrinkle solution, targeting specific areas where fine lines and wrinkles are most prominent. The treatment works 
            by temporarily relaxing the muscles responsible for wrinkle formation, resulting in a smoother and more youthful appearance.</li>
        <li><strong>Post-Treatment Care:</strong> After the injections, a soothing moisturiser and SPF may be applied to protect your skin and enhance recovery.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

        <li><strong>Reduction of Fine Lines and Wrinkles:</strong> Our Anti-Wrinkle Treatments effectively diminish the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, particularly around the forehead, eyes, and mouth.</li>
        <li><strong>Natural-Looking Results:</strong> The treatment provides a smooth and natural-looking result, preserving your ability to express emotions while reducing the signs of ageing.</li>
        <li><strong>Quick and Convenient:</strong> The procedure is minimally invasive, with little to no downtime, allowing you to return to your daily activities immediately.</li>
        <li><strong>Preventative Care:</strong> Regular treatments can help to prevent the development of new wrinkles and maintain a youthful appearance over time.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <h3>Aftercare:</h3>

    <p>
    Post-treatment, you may experience some mild redness or swelling at the injection sites, which typically resolves within a few hours. To ensure optimal results, avoid touching or massaging the treated areas and 
    protect your skin from excessive sun exposure. Our team will provide detailed aftercare instructions to support your recovery and enhance your results.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h3>Duration and Frequency:</h3>

    <p>
    The Anti-Wrinkle Treatment session usually takes about 15-30 minutes, depending on the areas being treated. For best results, we recommend follow-up treatments every 3-6 months, based on your individual response 
    and desired outcomes. Our professionals will work with you to create a personalised plan that aligns with your goals.
