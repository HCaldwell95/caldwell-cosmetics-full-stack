<h2>What to Expect</h2>
<br>

<h3>Consultation:</h3>

<p>
    Prior to your IPL Hair Removal session, you will undergo a comprehensive consultation with one of our skilled professionals. This will include assessing your skin and hair types, 
    discussing your hair removal goals, and determining the optimal treatment plan tailored to your needs.
</p>
<br>

<h3>Treatment Steps:</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> The area to be treated will be cleansed to remove any oils or residues. A cooling gel may be applied to enhance comfort during the procedure.</li>
    <li><strong>IPL Application:</strong> Using our state-of-the-art DYNAMIX® - Medical-Grade Laser and IPL Machine, pulses of light are directed at the hair follicles. The light energy 
        is absorbed by the pigment in the hair, which damages the follicle and inhibits future hair growth.</li>
    <li><strong>Post-Treatment Care:</strong> After the IPL treatment, a soothing moisturizer and SPF may be applied to protect your skin and reduce any potential redness or sensitivity.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h3>Benefits:</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Long-Term Hair Reducation:</strong> IPL Hair Removal targets hair follicles at the root, reducing hair growth over time and offering a more permanent solution compared to traditional methods.</li>
    <li><strong>Smooth Skin:</strong> Enjoy smooth, hair-free skin with fewer ingrown hairs and less irritation.</li>
    <li><strong>Minimal Discomfort:</strong> The IPL technology is designed to provide effective hair removal with minimal discomfort and downtime.</li>
    <li><strong>Precision:</strong> IPL technology allows for precise targeting of hair follicles, making it suitable for various areas of the body.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h3>Ideal For:</h3>

<p>
    Our IPL Hair Removal treatment is suitable for a wide range of skin and hair types. Whether you're looking to address hair on small areas like the upper lip or larger areas like the legs, the treatment can be 
    customised to suit your specific needs.
</p>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Aftercare:</h3>

<p>
    Following your IPL Hair Removal session, you may experience mild redness or sensitivity, which typically resolves within a few hours. It is essential to follow a gentle skincare routine and protect the treated 
    area from sun exposure to achieve the best results. Our team will provide detailed aftercare instructions to ensure optimal outcomes.
</p>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Duration and Frequency:</h3>


<p>
    Each IPL Hair Removal session typically lasts between 20 to 60 minutes, depending on the treatment area. For optimal results, we recommend a series of sessions spaced 4-6 weeks apart. Our specialists will work 
    with you to create a personalized treatment plan based on your individual hair removal goals.
