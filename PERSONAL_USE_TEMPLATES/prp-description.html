<h2>What to Expect</h2>
<br>

<h3>Consultation:</h3>

<p>
    Before your PRP treatment, you will have a comprehensive consultation with one of our experienced professionals. This allows us to evaluate your skin condition, discuss your 
    aesthetic goals, and determine the most effective PRP protocol tailored to your needs.
</p>
<br>

<h3>Treatment Steps:</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Blood Collection:</strong> A small amount of blood will be drawn from your arm, which will then be processed using a centrifuge to separate the platelet-rich plasma from other components.</li>
    <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> The PRP is carefully extracted and prepared for application. A topical numbing cream may be applied to ensure your comfort during the procedure.</li>
    <li><strong>PRP Application:</strong> The PRP is injected into targeted areas of the skin using fine needles. The growth factors in the PRP stimulate the body's natural healing processes, promoting collagen production and improving skin texture.</li>
    <li><strong>Post-Treatment Care:</strong> Following the PRP injections, a soothing moisturiser and SPF may be applied to protect and nurture your skin.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h3>Benefits:</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Rejuvenation:</strong> PRP therapy promotes the natural regeneration of skin cells, leading to a more youthful and refreshed appearance.</li>
    <li><strong>Collagen Production:</strong> The growth factors in PRP stimulate collagen synthesis, which helps to reduce fine lines and improve skin elasticity.</li>
    <li><strong>Improved Texture:</strong> PRP enhances skin texture and tone, reducing the appearance of acne scars, uneven pigmentation, and overall skin imperfections.</li>
    <li><strong>Natural Results:</strong> Since PRP utilizes your own blood, it offers a natural and biocompatible solution for skin rejuvenation with minimal risk of adverse reactions.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h3>Ideal For:</h3>

<p>
    PRP treatments are suitable for all skin types and can address a variety of concerns, including fine lines, wrinkles, acne scars, and overall skin texture. Whether you are seeking to enhance your complexion or 
    target specific areas of concern, PRP therapy offers a versatile and effective solution.
</p>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Aftercare:</h3>

<p>
    After your PRP treatment, you may experience some redness, swelling, or minor bruising, which typically resolves within a few days. To optimize results, it is important to follow a gentle skincare routine and 
    avoid direct sun exposure. Our team will provide personalized aftercare instructions to ensure the best possible outcome.
</p>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Duration and Frequency:</h3>

<p>
    The PRP treatment session usually takes about 60-90 minutes. For optimal results, a series of treatments spaced 4-6 weeks apart is often recommended. Our specialists will work with you to develop a customized 
    treatment plan based on your individual goals and skin condition.
